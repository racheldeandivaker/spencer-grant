# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Create a fellowship-ready Narrative Discussion that satisfies NAEd/Spencer Dissertation Fellowship requirements and maximizes reviewer alignment. The narrative will be no more than 10 double-spaced pages (11pt Times New Roman, 1-inch margins) with a two-page single-spaced bibliography appended as one combined upload.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This specification supports the goal of producing a persuasive, well-structured, and complete fellowship application narrative centered on education research, addressing equity and feasibility, and demonstrating strong authorship and scholarly grounding.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Narrative Structure and Formatting

**User Story:** As an applicant, I want a clear outline and formatting constraints so that my narrative meets the formal submission rules and fits within page limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN drafting THEN the narrative SHALL include the goals of the project, its contribution to the field, and the significance of the work, especially as it relates to education; place the project in context, and outline the theoretical grounding and the relevant literature; describe the research questions and research design, the methods of gathering and analyzing data, and interpretation techniques; if preliminary findings are available, describe them briefly to illustrate data treatment approaches; address clarity in treatment of data with respect to research questions (sections: Title/Header, Overview/Goals, Problem Significance to Education, Theoretical Framework, Literature Context, Research Questions, Research Design, Methods of Data Collection, Measures/Operationalization, Analysis/Interpretation, Preliminary Findings (if available), Contribution and Implications for Education, Feasibility/Work Plan Link, Limitations and Risks with Mitigations, Conclusion, and References separate, single-spaced, max two pages)
2. WHEN formatting THEN the narrative SHALL be ≤10 double-spaced pages, 1-inch margins, ≥11pt Times New Roman, with page numbers and running header including full name and email
3. WHEN preparing files THEN the narrative and bibliography SHALL be combined into a single upload, with optional appendices clearly labeled and non-essential

### Requirement 2: Significance and Relevance to Education

**User Story:** As a reviewer, I want to understand why the study matters to education so that I can assess its impact and priority.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading the significance section THEN it SHALL articulate the educational importance of the research question and relevance to practice and policy
2. WHEN describing equity THEN the narrative SHALL explain implications for underrepresented groups in STEM gateway courses and how findings may reduce equity gaps
3. WHEN situating scope THEN it SHALL state the unit(s) of analysis, settings, and populations in education contexts

### Requirement 3: Theoretical Grounding and Literature Integration

**User Story:** As a reviewer, I want theory and literature to anchor the study so that the approach is credible and well-informed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN presenting theory THEN the narrative SHALL specify core frameworks (e.g., Social Cognitive Career Theory; outcome expectations) and connect them to constructs and hypotheses
2. WHEN reviewing literature THEN it SHALL synthesize pertinent prior work on STEM persistence, gateway course barriers, academic support interventions, and optimization/simulation in education research
3. WHEN concluding the section THEN it SHALL identify gaps this dissertation addresses

### Requirement 4: Research Questions

**User Story:** As an applicant, I want clearly stated research questions so that the study's focus is unambiguous.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN listing RQs THEN they SHALL be concise, testable/answerable, and aligned to theory and methods
2. WHEN mapping RQs to methods THEN each RQ SHALL indicate corresponding data sources and analysis approaches

### Requirement 5: Research Design and Methods

**User Story:** As a reviewer, I want a transparent design and methods plan so that feasibility and rigor are evident.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN describing design THEN the narrative SHALL specify mixed-methods components: open-ended surveys, generative agent-based simulation, and an optimization component (where applicable), plus a brief real-world validation link
2. WHEN detailing data collection THEN it SHALL describe participants, recruitment, instruments, and constructs (e.g., outcome expectations), including operational definitions and reliability/validity plans
3. WHEN explaining measures THEN it SHALL specify measurement and classification decisions; include scales for quantitative data and approaches for using open-ended survey data to create accurate student agent simulations based on real student data
4. WHEN outlining analysis THEN it SHALL cover analytic strategies: statistical comparisons, effect sizes, equity gap metrics, simulation/output analysis, and validation approaches for comparing real student survey data to simulated student agent outcomes; include interpretation logic
5. WHEN discussing ethics THEN it SHALL address IRB, data privacy, and risks to participants with mitigations

### Requirement 6: Preliminary Findings or Pilot Evidence

**User Story:** As a reviewer, I want evidence of feasibility so that I can judge likelihood of success.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pilot data exist THEN the narrative SHALL briefly summarize preliminary results illustrating data treatment and coding/analysis
2. WHEN no pilot data exist THEN the narrative SHALL provide anticipated findings or prior related analyses to demonstrate analytic readiness

### Requirement 7: Feasibility and Work Plan Cohesion

**User Story:** As a reviewer, I want a credible plan so that the timeline fits the fellowship year.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN referencing timeline THEN the narrative SHALL link milestones (analysis, chapter drafting, committee submission) to the required work plan in the portal
2. WHEN discussing resources THEN it SHALL justify feasibility given constraints (time, budget, access to data, staffing) and clearly delimit scope

### Requirement 8: Authorship Quality and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a reviewer, I want the narrative to be clear to specialists and generalists so that key ideas are understandable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing THEN the narrative SHALL avoid jargon or define it on first use and include a brief general-audience framing
2. WHEN organizing THEN the narrative SHALL maintain clear headings, logical flow, and strong transitions
3. WHEN editing THEN the narrative SHALL target concision and coherence suitable for a 10-page limit

### Requirement 9: Compliance and Submission Readiness

**User Story:** As an applicant, I want a final checklist so that my narrative is submission-ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking compliance THEN the narrative SHALL meet NAEd/Spencer format, section coverage, and combined upload requirements
2. WHEN cross-referencing THEN the narrative SHALL align with evaluation criteria quoted in the fellowship guide (importance, feasibility, authorship quality, education relevance)
3. WHEN finalizing THEN references SHALL use APA style and a single-spaced bibliography within two pages

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each section should have a single, well-defined purpose
- **Modular Design**: Sections should be isolated and support the overall narrative
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize redundancy between sections
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clear transitions between narrative components

### Performance
- Page limit compliance: ≤10 double-spaced pages plus ≤2 single-spaced bibliography pages
- Reading efficiency: Clear section headers and logical flow for reviewer comprehension

### Security
- Data privacy: Protect participant confidentiality in any examples or preliminary findings
- IRB compliance: Ensure all research activities follow institutional review board requirements

### Reliability
- Citation accuracy: All in-text citations must appear in bibliography and vice versa
- Content consistency: Maintain consistent terminology for constructs, populations, and interventions

### Usability
- Accessibility: Write for an informed but cross-disciplinary audience
- Navigation: Clear section headers with page numbers, applicant's full name, and email address as a running header
