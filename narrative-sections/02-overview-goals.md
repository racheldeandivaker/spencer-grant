# Overview and Goals Section (0.5 pages)

## Project Overview

While STEM fields offer substantial financial benefits and career opportunities, persistent equity gaps limit access for underrepresented students, particularly in gateway courses like Calculus I that serve as critical decision points for degree persistence. Despite decades of academic support interventions ranging from tutoring to bridge programs, institutions lack systematic methods to identify which interventions most effectively enhance student outcome expectations—the beliefs about anticipated consequences of academic behaviors that strongly predict STEM persistence.

This dissertation addresses this challenge through an innovative methodological approach that combines generative agent-based modeling with optimization strategies to identify optimal academic support interventions for underrepresented students in gateway STEM courses. By leveraging large language model-driven simulations built from real student survey data, the study creates authentic digital representations of student experiences and responses to various interventions. These generative agents enable systematic testing of intervention effectiveness while accounting for student demographic diversity, institutional constraints, and competing educational goals.

## Goals of the Project

The primary goal of this research is to develop and validate a computational framework that optimizes academic support interventions to enhance outcome expectations among underrepresented students in gateway STEM courses. Specifically, the study aims to:

**1. Advance Methodological Innovation:** Pioneer the application of generative agent-based modeling in educational intervention research, demonstrating how AI-driven simulations can authentically represent student experiences and enable large-scale intervention testing while maintaining ecological validity through real student data integration.

**2. Optimize Educational Equity:** Develop optimization algorithms that balance multiple objectives—maximizing benefits for underrepresented students, improving overall outcomes, minimizing equity gaps, and maintaining cost-effectiveness—to identify intervention strategies that advance both excellence and equity in STEM education.

**3. Enhance Practical Decision-Making:** Create actionable guidance for institutions by identifying which academic support interventions (tutoring, supplemental instruction, coaching, bridge programs) are most effective for specific student populations under realistic resource constraints, moving beyond one-size-fits-all approaches toward evidence-based, targeted support strategies.

## Contribution to the Field

This research makes three distinct contributions to education and educational technology. **Methodologically**, it establishes generative agent-based modeling as a valid approach for educational intervention research, providing a replicable framework that other researchers can adapt for different populations and interventions. **Theoretically**, it extends Social Cognitive Career Theory by demonstrating how computational models can illuminate the mechanisms through which academic support influences outcome expectations, particularly for underrepresented students navigating gateway courses. **Practically**, it delivers optimization tools that enable institutions to make data-driven decisions about academic support allocation, potentially transforming how universities approach intervention design and resource distribution.

## Significance to Education

The significance of this work extends beyond methodological innovation to address fundamental challenges in educational equity and institutional effectiveness. Gateway STEM courses represent critical junctures where student trajectories are determined, yet current intervention approaches often rely on intuition rather than systematic evidence about effectiveness across diverse student populations. By providing institutions with tools to identify optimal interventions for specific contexts and student demographics, this research directly supports efforts to broaden participation in STEM fields and reduce persistent achievement gaps.

Furthermore, the study's focus on outcome expectations—students' beliefs about the consequences of their academic efforts—addresses a key psychological mechanism underlying persistence decisions. Unlike interventions that focus solely on academic performance, this approach recognizes that students' perceptions of future benefits significantly influence their commitment to STEM pathways. By optimizing interventions to enhance these expectations, particularly among underrepresented students who may face additional barriers and uncertainties, the research contributes to more comprehensive and psychologically-informed approaches to student support.

The computational framework developed through this research also offers scalability advantages that traditional intervention studies cannot match. While randomized controlled trials of academic support are resource-intensive and limited in scope, generative agent simulations enable testing of numerous intervention combinations across diverse student populations at a fraction of the cost and time investment. This efficiency gain is particularly valuable for institutions serving diverse student bodies with varying support needs and limited resources for intervention implementation.
