## The Promise and Challenge of STEM Higher Education

STEM fields represent pathways to economic mobility and career advancement that are essential to achieving higher education's equity mission. Graduates with STEM degrees earn substantially higher salaries, with a median income advantage of $20,000 compared to non-STEM careers, and benefit from faster job growth and greater career stability (NSF, 2022; NCSES, 2023). These fields also develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation capabilities that make graduates highly competitive in an increasingly technology-driven economy (NSB, 2024). Yet despite these clear benefits, persistent representation gaps prevent many students from accessing these opportunities, creating what amounts to a systematic exclusion from economic advancement.

## Persistent Equity Gaps in STEM Participation

The underrepresentation of certain groups in STEM fields represents one of higher education's most intractable equity challenges. Women earn nearly half of all bachelor's degrees but represent only one-third of degrees in many STEM fields, while racially minoritized students, first-generation college students, and those from low-income backgrounds face compounding barriers to STEM participation and success (Fry, Kennedy, & Funk, 2021; Graham et al., 2013; NCSES, 2021). These disparities manifest not only in degree completion rates but also in salary outcomes, where women and racially underrepresented graduates consistently earn less than their peers in similar positions.

The barriers facing underrepresented students are particularly acute for first-generation and low-income populations, who are less likely to have access to advanced high school coursework, more likely to work while enrolled, and often lack the social and cultural capital necessary to navigate complex academic environments effectively (Engle & Tinto, 2008; Stephens et al., 2012). When combined with the inherent challenges of STEM curricula, these disadvantages create cumulative barriers that contribute to lower persistence rates and perpetuate underrepresentation in STEM degree completion and career entry.

## Gateway Courses as Critical Decision Points

Gateway STEM courses such as Calculus I and Physics I serve as particularly consequential barriers, functioning as "weed-out" courses that disproportionately affect underrepresented students and significantly influence persistence decisions (Ellis et al., 2016; Bressoud et al., 2015). These introductory courses are characterized by high failure and withdrawal rates, and poor performance not only reduces students' academic confidence but also fundamentally alters their beliefs about the viability of STEM career pathways. When students struggle in gateway courses, they may conclude that the anticipated benefits of STEM careers do not justify the academic challenges they are experiencing, leading to major changes and career redirections that perpetuate existing equity gaps.

The significance of gateway course experiences extends beyond immediate academic outcomes to shape students' outcome expectations—their beliefs about the anticipated consequences of pursuing STEM degrees and careers. Research in Social Cognitive Career Theory demonstrates that these expectations are powerful predictors of persistence, often more influential than actual academic ability in determining whether students continue in STEM pathways (Lent et al., 1994; Garriott et al., 2017). Students with positive outcome expectations about STEM careers—beliefs about financial security, career satisfaction, and opportunities to contribute meaningfully to society—are more likely to persist through academic challenges, while those with diminished expectations are more likely to leave even when academically capable.

## The Intervention Effectiveness Challenge

Higher education institutions have responded to these challenges by implementing numerous academic support interventions, including tutoring programs, supplemental instruction, bridge programs, peer mentoring, and academic coaching. While many of these interventions demonstrate positive effects on student performance and retention, they are often resource-intensive to implement and sustain, requiring significant investments in staffing, training, and ongoing support (Chen, 2013; Crisp et al., 2009). More critically, institutions lack systematic methods to determine which interventions are most effective for specific student populations or how to optimize intervention design given institutional constraints and competing priorities.

This knowledge gap has profound implications for educational practice and policy. Without evidence-based guidance about intervention effectiveness, institutions may invest resources in approaches that are less impactful or fail to address the specific needs of underrepresented students. The result is often well-intentioned but suboptimal allocation of support resources, potentially perpetuating rather than reducing equity gaps in STEM education.

## Implications for Educational Practice and Policy

The problem this research addresses has direct implications for educational practice at multiple levels. For individual institutions, the ability to identify optimal academic support strategies could dramatically improve resource allocation efficiency and student outcomes, particularly for underrepresented populations who face the greatest barriers to STEM success. At the policy level, evidence-based intervention optimization could inform funding priorities and programmatic requirements, ensuring that investments in STEM education equity produce maximum impact.

Furthermore, the focus on outcome expectations as a key mechanism addresses a fundamental gap in how institutions approach student support. While most interventions target academic skills or knowledge deficits, fewer address the psychological and motivational factors that influence persistence decisions. By optimizing interventions to enhance students' beliefs about the value and attainability of STEM careers, this research contributes to more comprehensive and psychologically-informed approaches to educational equity.

The potential for scalable impact through computational optimization also represents a significant advancement for the field. Traditional intervention research relies on resource-intensive studies that test single approaches with limited populations, constraining the scope of evidence available to guide practice. The computational framework proposed in this study enables systematic testing of numerous intervention combinations across diverse student populations, potentially accelerating the development of evidence-based practice in ways that traditional research methods cannot match.
