# Theoretical Framework

## Social Cognitive Career Theory

This study is grounded in Lent, Brown, and Hackett's (1994) **Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT)**, which provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how students develop career interests, make educational choices, and persist in academic programs. SCCT is particularly relevant for examining student experiences in STEM gateway courses because it addresses the cognitive and social factors that influence academic persistence and career development.

SCCT is built on three core constructs that work interactively to shape academic and career outcomes: **self-efficacy beliefs** (confidence in one's ability to perform specific tasks), **outcome expectations** (anticipated consequences of behaviors), and **personal goals** (intentions to engage in particular activities or achieve specific outcomes). These constructs operate within a broader social context that includes environmental supports and barriers, such as institutional resources, academic interventions, and systemic inequities that particularly affect underrepresented students in STEM fields.

## Outcome Expectations as the Central Construct

For this research, **outcome expectations** serves as the primary theoretical construct linking gateway course experiences to STEM persistence decisions. Outcome expectations represent students' beliefs about the likely consequences of pursuing a particular course of action—in this case, continuing in a STEM major despite challenges encountered in gateway courses like Calculus I.

Outcome expectations encompass both **physical outcomes** (such as improved grades and academic success) and **social outcomes** (such as recognition, career opportunities, and belonging in STEM communities). For underrepresented students, outcome expectations are particularly influenced by their perceptions of whether STEM environments will be welcoming and whether the long-term benefits of a STEM degree outweigh the immediate academic and social challenges they face.

Research demonstrates that positive outcome expectations are critical for STEM persistence, especially when students encounter academic difficulties. Students who maintain positive expectations about the benefits of continuing in STEM—despite struggling with gateway coursework—are more likely to persist than those whose outcome expectations become negative due to poor academic performance or unwelcoming environments.

## Connecting Theory to Study Constructs

This theoretical framework directly informs the study's focus on identifying effective academic support interventions for underrepresented students in STEM gateway courses. The SCCT framework suggests that interventions should target the enhancement of outcome expectations by:

1. **Addressing academic barriers** that negatively impact students' beliefs about their future success in STEM
2. **Providing social support** that reinforces positive career outcome expectations
3. **Creating environments** where students can envision themselves succeeding in STEM fields

The study's mixed-methods approach—combining optimization strategies with generative agent-based modeling—aligns with SCCT's emphasis on the complex interplay between individual cognition and environmental factors. By using real student survey data to create generative agents and testing intervention effectiveness through optimization models, this research captures both the individual-level cognitive processes (outcome expectations) and system-level constraints (resource limitations, institutional factors) that SCCT identifies as crucial for understanding academic persistence.

## Theoretical Hypotheses

Based on SCCT, this study operates under the hypothesis that academic support interventions will be most effective when they directly enhance students' outcome expectations about pursuing STEM careers. Specifically, interventions that help students see a clear path from current academic challenges to future STEM success should produce the strongest positive effects on persistence intentions.

Furthermore, SCCT suggests that intervention effectiveness will vary based on students' background characteristics and environmental contexts. The theory predicts that underrepresented students may require more intensive or targeted support to achieve the same positive outcome expectations as their majority peers, due to additional barriers they face in STEM environments.

This theoretical grounding provides the foundation for developing and testing interventions that address not just immediate academic needs, but the broader cognitive and social factors that influence long-term STEM persistence among underrepresented students in gateway courses.
