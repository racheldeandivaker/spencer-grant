Got it—let’s switch from “discover lots of ideas” to **finding the *best* intervention** (global and, if you choose, per‑student‑context) under realistic constraints. Below is a concrete, Python‑first blueprint that treats your simulator as a noisy, expensive, black‑box function and uses **constrained Bayesian optimization** to locate the optimum.

---

## 1) Formalize the optimization target

You’ll optimize the intervention $x$ (a mix of categorical + numeric knobs) to maximize the **uplift in outcome expectations** while enforcing constraints (budget, equity, implementability).

### Decision variables (examples)

`delivery ∈ {tutoring, SI, coaching, peer, writing, bridge, ai_copilot}`
`modality ∈ {in_person, online, hybrid}`
`dosage_min_per_week ∈ [0, 180]` (int)
`sessions_per_week ∈ [0, 5]` (int)
`targeting ∈ {universal, first_gen, UR, low_prep}`
`peer_match ∈ {none, same_major, identity, mixed}`
`frame ∈ {career, community, belonging, role_model, growth}`
`nudge_channel ∈ {none, email, sms, lms}`
`nudge_per_week ∈ [0, 3]`
`instructor_signal ∈ {0,1}`
`ai_support ∈ {none, chatbot, copilot}`

### Objective and constraints

Let simulator return metrics $\hat{m}(x)$ averaged over replicate seeds and agent cohorts:

* $E[\Delta OE(x)]$ (primary; report as Cohen’s $d$ and mean shift)
* $Cost(x)$ per student
* $Gap(x)$ = equity gap (UR vs. non‑UR uplift; want small)
* $Var(x)$ or robustness SD across seeds/cohorts

Choose one **primary objective** and **hard constraints**:

**Global optimum (population level)**

$$
\max_{x} \;\; E[\Delta OE(x)]
\quad \text{s.t.} \quad 
\begin{cases}
Cost(x) \le B \\
|Gap(x)| \le \epsilon \\
\text{RobustnessSD}(x) \le \rho 
\end{cases}
$$

**Optionally risk‑aware:** maximize **CVaR$_\alpha$** or **mean–variance**
$\max_x \; E[\Delta OE(x)] - \lambda \sqrt{Var(x)}$ to prefer reliable interventions.

**Per‑student (personalized) optimum (optional later)**
$\pi^\*(c) = \arg\max_{x} E[\Delta OE(x)\mid \text{context } c]$ with same constraints, where $c$ contains prior prep, first‑gen, time availability, etc.

---

## 2) Make your simulator “optimizer‑ready”

Write a single function that returns **means and standard errors** for all metrics (optimizers need noise estimates).

```python
def simulate_intervention(params, rng_seed=0, n_agents=200, n_reps=3):
    """
    Returns:
      metrics = {
        "effect_d": (mean, sem),
        "effect_mean": (mean, sem),
        "cost_per_student": (mean, sem=0.0),    # deterministic cost model
        "equity_gap": (abs_gap, sem),
        "robustness_sd": (sd, sem≈0.0)
      }
    """
    # 1) Construct cohort(s): stratify to preserve UR groups and course realities.
    # 2) Common Random Numbers (CRN): reuse the same agent seeds across params
    #    to reduce variance in comparisons.
    # 3) For each replicate: run agents pre/post, compute effect metrics.
    # 4) Aggregate means and SEMs; compute deterministic cost from params.
    return metrics
```

**Tips for statistical efficiency**

* **CRN**: Fix agent identities/seeds across different $x$ to reduce noise.
* **Replicates**: 2–3 during search; more later for “intensification.”
* **Bootstrap** inside each evaluation to get SEMs.
* **Caching**: memoize LLM calls keyed by `(agent, scenario snippet, params projection)`.

---

## 3) Use **constrained Bayesian Optimization** (Ax + BoTorch)

This gives you **sample‑efficient global search** with principled handling of noise and constraints—ideal when each sim call is expensive.

### A. Define the evaluation function Ax expects

Ax’s `optimize` wants a function that maps parameter dict → `{metric_name: (mean, sem)}`.

```python
# evaluation.py
def evaluate(params):
    m = simulate_intervention(params, rng_seed=0, n_agents=150, n_reps=2)
    return {
        "effect_d": m["effect_d"],
        "cost_per_student": m["cost_per_student"],
        "equity_gap": m["equity_gap"],           # use absolute gap in the simulator
        "robustness_sd": m["robustness_sd"],
    }
```

### B. Call Ax with **single objective + outcome constraints**

This directly encodes “find the best intervention that satisfies constraints.”

```python
from ax.service.managed_loop import optimize

BUDGET = 50.0   # example $/student
GAP_MAX = 0.10  # max allowed absolute equity gap in Cohen's d units (or scale units)
ROB_MAX = 0.20  # allowable robustness sd

search_space = [
    {"name":"delivery","type":"choice","values":["tutoring","SI","coaching","peer","writing","bridge","ai_copilot"]},
    {"name":"modality","type":"choice","values":["in_person","online","hybrid"]},
    {"name":"dosage_min_per_week","type":"range","bounds":[0,180],"value_type":"int"},
    {"name":"sessions_per_week","type":"range","bounds":[0,5],"value_type":"int"},
    {"name":"targeting","type":"choice","values":["universal","first_gen","UR","low_prep"]},
    {"name":"peer_match","type":"choice","values":["none","same_major","identity","mixed"]},
    {"name":"frame","type":"choice","values":["career","community","belonging","role_model","growth"]},
    {"name":"nudge_channel","type":"choice","values":["none","email","sms","lms"]},
    {"name":"nudge_per_week","type":"range","bounds":[0,3],"value_type":"int"},
    {"name":"instructor_signal","type":"choice","values":[0,1]},
    {"name":"ai_support","type":"choice","values":["none","chatbot","copilot"]},
]

best_params, best_vals, exp, model = optimize(
    parameters=search_space,
    evaluation_function=evaluate,
    objective_name="effect_d",
    minimize=False,
    outcome_constraints=[
        f"cost_per_student <= {BUDGET}",
        f"equity_gap <= {GAP_MAX}",
        f"robustness_sd <= {ROB_MAX}",
    ],
    total_trials=200,                       # adjust to your compute budget
    choose_generation_strategy=True,        # uses Sobol → BO automatically
    random_seed=11,
)
```

**What this does**

* Starts with **Sobol** (space‑filling) to learn the landscape.
* Switches to **Bayesian optimization** (GPEI/qNEI) to propose new $x$ with the highest expected improvement **subject to constraints**.
* Uses your SEMs to model noise; it will naturally allocate more trials where uncertainty is high.

> Prefer the Ax route over ad‑hoc TPE when the goal is a principled **global optimum under constraints**.

### C. If you truly need multi‑objective (e.g., treat cost as 2nd objective)

Use Ax/BoTorch’s **qNEHVI** to get a **Pareto front**, *then* pick the point that meets a strict budget and maximizes effect. The constrained single‑objective setup above already encodes the “optimal under budget,” which is simpler for your dissertation’s main goal.

---

## 4) Make it **robust** (so the “optimum” generalizes)

Even if novelty isn’t a goal, **robustness** is—so your chosen $x^\*$ works across sections/instructors/semester mixes.

* **Scenario sets**: Evaluate each $x$ over multiple *scenarios* (e.g., different section cultures, instructor styles, time‑of‑day). Aggregate the objective as:

  * mean across scenarios (and return SEM), **and**
  * compute CVaR$_{20\%}$ or the **worst‑quartile mean**, then either:

    * impose a constraint $ \text{CVaR}_{20\%}(x) \ge \tau$, or
    * optimize $ E[\Delta OE(x)] - \lambda \big(E[\Delta OE(x)]- \text{CVaR}_{20\%}(x)\big)$.
* **Equity as a constraint**: keep `|Gap(x)| ≤ ε` hard; or add `min_group_uplift ≥ τ` to ensure no subgroup is left behind.
* **Intensification** (final check): once Ax proposes a winner and a couple of runner‑ups, **re‑evaluate those with larger `n_agents` and `n_reps`** to shrink SEM and confirm ranking; then re‑register those refined observations back into Ax to update the posterior before final selection.

---

## 5) If you want per‑student (or per‑segment) optimal choices

Your global optimum $x^\*$ is easy to defend. But you can also find the **optimal mapping** $c \mapsto x$ (policy) with a **contextual optimizer** on top of a short list of finalists:

**Procedure**

1. Run BO as above; keep the top $K$ feasible interventions $\{x_1,\dots,x_K\}$.
2. Treat them as **arms** in a **contextual bandit** where context $c$ = student features.
3. Train **LinUCB** or **Thompson Sampling** in‑simulation to minimize regret; export the learned policy $\pi(c)$.

Packages: `contextualbandits`, `mabwiser`, or roll your own LinUCB (it’s \~50 lines).
This yields “optimal for the student you’re looking at,” still under budget and equity constraints (filter arms to feasible ones only).

---

## 6) Practical engineering (so it runs on a grad‑student budget)

* **Caching**: cache LLM calls and per‑agent outcomes; also cache the whole `simulate_intervention(params, seed)` result.
* **Parallelism**: evaluate the Ax “batch” suggestions concurrently using `concurrent.futures` or `ray`.
* **Common Random Numbers**: same agent seeds across candidates within a batch; rotate seeds across batches.
* **Logging & reproducibility**: track params/metrics/seeds/prompt versions in **MLflow** (or a CSV + JSON if you prefer).
* **Guardrails**: hard‑exclude unethical or non‑implementable configurations in the search space (Ax supports conditional parameters if certain choices imply others).

---

## 7) Post‑optimization reporting (defensible “optimal” choice)

For your dissertation write‑up:

1. **Problem definition** with constraints (eqs. above), search space table, and cost model.
2. **Optimizer details**: Ax/BoTorch, noise model, initialization trials, total trials, constraint thresholds.
3. **Convergence checks**: best‑seen trace and (if used) hypervolume trace; plateau criteria.
4. **Winner verification**: intensified re‑evaluation (bigger $n$), 95% CIs, pairwise bootstrap vs. runner‑ups, and **probability of superiority**.
5. **Robustness**: scenario‑wise performance and CVaR plots.
6. **Equity audit**: subgroup uplifts and residual gap (with CIs).
7. **Sensitivity**: show the optimum is stable under small changes to budget $B$ and gap threshold $\epsilon$.

---

## 8) Minimal code you can drop in

**Cost model & constraints**

```python
def cost_per_student(params, staff_rate=25, room_rate_per_hr=10, ai_token_cost=0.01):
    staff_min = params["sessions_per_week"] * params["dosage_min_per_week"]
    staff_cost = (staff_min/60) * staff_rate
    room_cost  = (staff_min/60) * room_rate_per_hr
    ai_cost    = 0.0 if params["ai_support"]=="none" else 0.05  # placeholder
    return staff_cost + room_cost + ai_cost
```

**Evaluation wrapper for Ax**

```python
def evaluate(params):
    # Ensure feasibility shortcuts (optional)
    if params["dosage_min_per_week"] == 0 or params["sessions_per_week"] == 0:
        # Trivial “no support”: still evaluate to let BO learn the baseline.
        pass

    m = simulate_intervention(params, rng_seed=hash(frozenset(params.items())) % (2**32), 
                              n_agents=150, n_reps=2)

    # Make sure equity gap is absolute if you constrain it that way:
    mean_gap, sem_gap = m["equity_gap"]
    return {
        "effect_d": m["effect_d"],
        "cost_per_student": m["cost_per_student"],
        "equity_gap": (abs(mean_gap), sem_gap),
        "robustness_sd": m["robustness_sd"],
    }
```

**Run Ax**

```python
best_params, best_vals, experiment, model = optimize(
    parameters=search_space,
    evaluation_function=evaluate,
    objective_name="effect_d",
    minimize=False,
    outcome_constraints=[
        f"cost_per_student <= {BUDGET}",
        f"equity_gap <= {GAP_MAX}",
        f"robustness_sd <= {ROB_MAX}",
    ],
    total_trials=200,
    choose_generation_strategy=True,
    random_seed=11,
)
```

**Intensify the winner (confirm it’s truly best)**

```python
def intensify(params_list, n_agents=600, n_reps=6):
    out = []
    for p in params_list:
        m = simulate_intervention(p, rng_seed=123, n_agents=n_agents, n_reps=n_reps)
        out.append((p, m))
    return out

finalists = [best_params] + [t.arm.parameters for t in experiment.trials.values() 
                             if t.status.is_completed][:4]
verified = intensify(finalists)
# Rank by effect_d mean subject to constraints; report CIs and pairwise bootstrap.
```

---

## 9) What “optimal” means in your dissertation

* You’ve **explicitly defined** optimality (maximize uplift) and **encoded hard institutional constraints** (budget, equity, robustness).
* You used a **sample‑efficient, noise‑aware, constrained BO** method to find $x^\*$.
* You **verified** the winner with higher‑fidelity evaluations and provided **uncertainty** and **robustness** analyses.
* Optional: you can present a second result—the **personalized policy**—showing improved outcomes when matching interventions to contexts, while still honoring constraints.

If you want, I can turn this into a tiny starter repo (Ax config, simulator stub with CRN/caching hooks, MLflow logging, and a one‑click script to run the constrained BO and generate the plots you’ll need for the dissertation figures).


## The simple idea

You want to choose the **best student‑support plan** (the *intervention*) that **most increases students’ outcome expectations** in Calculus I, **without** breaking a budget and **while** keeping results equitable.

* Think of an intervention as a **recipe** with knobs: delivery type, modality, dosage, messaging, nudges, etc.
* You have a **practice field** (your simulator with generative student agents). You can try a recipe, watch what happens, and read the scoreboard:

  * **Effect** (how much outcome expectations rise),
  * **Cost per student**,
  * **Equity gap** (difference in effect for underrepresented vs. other students),
  * **Stability** (how consistent the effect is across runs).

Your problem is: **find the recipe that scores highest on Effect while obeying rules** like “Cost ≤ budget” and “Equity gap ≤ small.”

---

## Why optimization is needed

You could test every possible recipe—but there are too many combinations. Optimization is a **smart way to search**:

* Try a few,
* Learn from results,
* Pick **the next** recipe **most likely to be better**, given what you’ve learned,
* Repeat until you stop seeing real improvement.

This is faster and cheaper than brute force.

---

## The loop (in 6 steps)

1. **Define the goal and rules**

   * Goal: maximize **Effect**.
   * Rules (constraints): **Cost ≤ budget**, **Equity gap ≤ threshold**, **Stability ≥ threshold**.

2. **Describe the knobs (search space)**

   * Example: delivery = tutoring/SI/coaching/…; dosage 0–180 min/week; modality in‑person/online; etc.

3. **Build one function** (the “practice match”)

   * Input = a specific recipe (values for the knobs).
   * Run the simulator on a cohort of agents, get the scoreboard (Effect, Cost, Equity gap, Stability).
   * Because simulations are a bit noisy, run a couple of repeats and **average** the score.

4. **Start with a few diverse tries**

   * Sample some very different recipes to get an initial feel for what works at all.

5. **Use a smart picker (Bayesian optimization)**

   * Imagine keeping a **rough map** of which regions of the recipe space look promising.
   * After each try, the map updates.
   * The smart picker chooses the **next** recipe that best balances:

     * **Exploring** uncertain areas (could be great, we don’t know yet), and
     * **Exploiting** areas that already look good.
   * It **only proposes recipes that obey your rules** (budget, equity, stability).

6. **Stop and confirm**

   * When new tries aren’t beating the best one by much, **re‑test the top 2–5 recipes with more agents/repeats** to shrink uncertainty.
   * Pick the **winner** that still meets all rules.

---

## What you get at the end

* A **single, defensible “best” intervention**:
  “Under budget, equitable, and the highest proven increase in outcome expectations.”
* Uncertainty bars you can put in your dissertation (e.g., 95% CI on the effect).
* A transparent record of what was tried and why the winner won.

---

## Optional: “best for whom?”

Once you have a shortlist of strong, feasible recipes, you can personalize:

* Treat those recipes as “choices,” and use a simple **contextual bandit** (a learner) that, given a student’s context (first‑gen, time availability, prior prep), picks the **best recipe for that student**.
* Same loop, same scoreboard—now the goal is the **best match** per context, still under the same budget/equity rules.

---

## A picture to keep in mind

```
[Choose recipe knobs] → [Simulator scrimmage] → [Scoreboard: Effect, Cost, Equity, Stability]
           ↑                                                     |
           |——————— Smart picker updates its “map” ————————←────|
```

The **smart picker** is the optimization algorithm (Bayesian optimization).
The **map** is its evolving belief about which recipes look best.

---

## Jargon → plain English

* **Objective**: what you’re trying to maximize (Effect on outcome expectations).
* **Constraints**: hard rules (budget, equity, stability).
* **Search space**: all possible recipes (all knob combinations).
* **Noisy**: the same recipe gives slightly different results each run (so we average).
* **Bayesian optimization**: “learn‑as‑you‑go” strategy that chooses the next test intelligently.
* **Global optimum**: the best recipe across the whole space, not just “good nearby.”

---

## What makes this trustworthy

* You **average** over multiple runs to reduce randomness.
* You **respect constraints** at every step (so the final pick is usable in the real world).
* You **confirm** the winner with extra runs before you publish.

If you want, I can turn this into a one‑page checklist you can follow while you implement—no formulas, just steps to tick off.
